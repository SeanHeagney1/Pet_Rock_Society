    <p>There are 3 types of rocks and each is formed in a specific way, these are:<br><br> Igneus- Formed when molten rock, lava or magma, cools and solidifies.<br><img src="src/images/igneus.jpg" alt="Igneus_rocks"><br><br> Sedimentary- Formed when particles
        settle from water or air or from the precipitation of minerals from water, which form in layers.<br><img src="src/images/sedimentary.jpg" alt="Sedimentary rocks"><br><br> Metamorphic-formed when existing rocks are changed by heat, pressure or
        reactive fluids such as hot, mineral laden water.<br> <img src="src/images/metamorphic_rocks.jpg">
