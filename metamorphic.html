        <h2>Metamorphic rocks are very interesting because they were once sedimentary or igneus rocks squished together due to intense pressure/heat. These sturdy rocks have very strong personalities. Very sure of themselves.</h2>

        <h2>Slate</h2>
        <img src="src/images/slate.jpg" alt="Slate">
        <p>Slate is the finest grained metamorphic rock you can get. slate started off as a
            <a href="sedimentary.html">sedimentary</a> rock before being metamorphosised. Not the best pet rock as it can be very dismissive but, fun fact, slate rocks can multiply into smaller slate rocks giving you many pets. Slate rocks are happy helping
            with DIY.</p>
        <h2>Quartzite</h2>
        <img src=" src/images/quartzite.jpg " alt="Quartzite">
        <p>Quartzite, sandstone that has been converted into a solid quartz rock. Unlike sandstones, quartzites are free from pores and have a smooth fracture. Nice for decorative purposes. This pet rock can come in the shape of a kitchen side, being within
            your home at all times. Extremely happy preparing food with owner.</p>
        <h2>Hornfels</h2>
        <img src="hornfels.jpg" alt="Hornfels">
        <p>Hornfels. Hornfels is a fine-grained metamorphic rock formed by the action of heat on clay rocks, known as contact metamorphism. These rocks can be found in all shapes and sizes, from tiny millimetres to mountain sizes. Another pet rock that can
            be quite passive and show no emotion. Very happy watching the world go by.</p>
