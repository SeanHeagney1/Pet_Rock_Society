<br> is a new line 
<img> can also add image with <url> but if user of other website deletes it then its gone for your website aswell.


<a></a> always have link within first anchor



alt="" is for the visually impaired. use this in <img>

target="_blank" keeps the viewer on my website

<head>You dont have to mess with this</head>

<body> anything you want to be seen on your website goes in here </body>

<div>this divides the website into sections divs can be inside other divs!</div>


<!-- 
css stuff -->

when using a link insert target="_blank"  this will open another web tab instead of opening link on same page.

DO NOT USE <style></style> IN HTML

to link a page to css use link:css function before <head></head> and title.

start at the top and work your way down with css.

<div class="in this divide"    use this to use css that focuses on this div in the html.

instead of using class you can use id. when using id instead of using the . function you use #. id can only be used for 1 element while class can cover all. if creating an anchor it will bring the user straight to the part you want when using id.(very handy).

cover whole page on css using *{box-sizing: border-box;
 <!-- padding:25px} play with this  -->
"padding" works clockwise. pixels from the top, then from the right, then from the bottom and then from the left. you can also use % for padding.


height and width of an element. 
auto-browser automatically fits it.

font_family to change font in <div></div>

when changing the colour of a link or clickable link use ".nav a" to focus on the anchor. to remove the underline you can use "text-decoration: none;"
