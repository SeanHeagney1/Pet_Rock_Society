        <h2>Lets take a look at a few types of Igneus Rocks. Ingeus rocks are known to be tempermental due to the intense way in which they were formed but given enough time, patience and love, they make for an extremely affectionate pet rock.</h2>

        <h2>Basalt</h2>
        <img src="basalt.jpg" class="rock" alt="Basalt">
        <p>Basalt is a fine-grained, dark-colored extrusive igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene. Grumpy and lazy.</p>
        <h2>Pumice</h2>
        <img src="pumice.jpg" class="rock" alt="pumice">
        <p>Pumice is an extremely porous rock formed during very violent volcanic eruptions. Pumice stones are quite abrasive in temper and are very calm when sharing a bath with their owner.</p>
        <h2>Obsidian</h2>
        <img src="obsidian.jpg" class="rock" alt="obsidian">
        <p>Obsidian is a dark-colored volcanic glass that forms from the very rapid cooling of molten rock material. It cools so rapidly that crystals do not form. These pet rocks are cool characters, calm most of the time and very pretty to look at.</p>
