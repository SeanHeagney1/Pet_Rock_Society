        <h2>Now let's take a look at some sedimentary rocks. These type of rocks are a lot more relaxed in manner, having had a lot of time to meditate.</h2>

        <h2>Alabaster</h2>
        <img src="OIP.jpg" alt="Alabaster">
        <p>Alabaster is a common name, not a geological name, for massive gypsum rock. It is a translucent stone, usually white, that is used for sculpture and interior decorations. Alabaster pet rocks know their own beauty, which shows in their behaviour.
            Very happy when displayed.</p>
        <h2>Chert</h2>
        <img src="chert.jpg" alt="Chert">
        <p>Chert is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral chalcedonyâ€”cryptocrystalline silica in crystals of submicroscopic size. Chert is formed under intense pressure under water. Can be mistaken for shale yet easy to tell the difference due
            to chert being a lot more durable.. Chert rocks are quite neutral in temperment and are happy being displayed in fish tanks.</p>
        <h2>Sandstone</h2>
        <img src="sandstone.jpg" alt="Sandstone">
        <p>Sandstone is made of sand grains (0.05mm to 2mm) that may have been deposited in the sea, by rivers, or in deserts, and later cemented together by minerals precipitated from groundwater. These Pet rocks are relatively fragile so watch what you
            say to them.</p>
